# githubnotes
-> Git/Github ---> it is source code management tool which helps you to manage the application code.
-> Git is local repository which is on you local machine.
-> Github is centralised repository were you need to login using username/passwd.

-> git init -> which helps to convert normal directory to git directory.(which initilise the git congiguration).

-> Git clone -> were we can download entire repository from github to local git
     git clone <github url> (url -> github repo url)
     cd <reponame>  -> go inside directory
     vi filename    -> to create new file (esc->shift:->wq)
     git add .      -> . indicates all files
     git commit -m "message" -> (-m is message)
     git push origin branchname  ->push code to github.
     git status  -> to see the status before and after command exection for both add&commit.

     git pull origin branchname  ->pull code into local git

-> git branching ---> Branching will helps developers to work parallely or samintaniously with out any dependency on each other.

     git branch <bname> --> it will create branch 
     git checkout <bname>  -> switch from one to another branch

     git checkout -b <bname>  -> create and switch to that branch
     git branch -d <bname>    -> delete branch (-d delete)
     git branch    -> list the branches which are on local git
     git branch -a  -> it will list branches from both git and github. (-a   all branches)

-> git log  --> commit history display
   git log --oneline  shows commit history with less content

-> git diff <bname> <bname>     -> it will show diff b/w two branches
   git diff <commitid> <commitid>  -> it will show diff b/w two commit id's
   git show <commitid>   -> to see details info for commit id   

-> git merge --> combine two diff branches into single branch.
                  --> github->pullrequest->create pullrequest->merge request
   git checkout main
   git merge <main> <test>    -> it is merging test to main branch.  

-> git stash  --> to store current working directory temporarly 
            git stash      -> save the current work dir to stash
            git stash list -> show the list of saved items
            git stash apply -> to get back the save curent dir
            git stash drop  -> delete the saved items from stash

-> .gitignore  --> .gitignore file will helps to skip/avoid the unwanted files while pushing into github.
    vi .girignore --> *.log

-> git reset --> to undo the changes/// -> move from current state to previous state.

   git reset <filename> 

-> Setup git in Linux VM
    sudo yum install git -y
    ssh-keygen -> enter -> enter-> enter 
    to get key -> cat /home/ec2-user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    copy the key to github account in settings -> SSH option
    git clone <repo SSH URL> -> yes -> enter ---> it will start clone.

Maven Tool:
-> Maven is build automation tool
-> using maven we are goint to build the application code written by developers
-> After build it will generate target folder and .jar file inside init (target/***.jar)
-> maven is having lifecycle which contains diff stages/phases
     -> generate resource - Generate required de[pendencies to build application code using maven.
     -> Compile code -- convert code into binary language (machine readable)
     -> Unit test --- Maven will test internally diff test cases
     -> Package ---- Creating .jar file from the code (copying all the required code into jar)
     -> install ----- Install the .jar on maven server
     -> Deploy ----- Deploy is ntg but upload/deploy the dependencies and .jar files to maven repository.
     -> Clean ----- Claen the existing .jar file and recreate new .jar file.
-> When we download and install maven
     -> .M2 folder ---- were it containes entire configuration of maven.
         settings.xml ---- Maven repo URL then username/password.
         pom.xml ---- when we execute maven commnd will simply follow the pom.xml file
     -> Using single command we can execute the entire maven lifecycle
         mvn clean install
-> Download and install maven in windows/Linux
Windows:
    -> https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-maven-windows (Installation steps)
    -> https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi (download maven package)
Linux:
   -> Sudo yum install maven -y
   -> maven -version

-> Make sure execute maven command were the POM file is.

What is Docker?
Docker is light weight container, were you can build and run your application on docker.
Docker is very fast in build and running application.
Docker will only support single application deployment.

-> hardware-==> kernel OS----->Docker engine---->Application
-> Install docker on linux machine
    * sudo yum install docker -y  (Install docker on our VM).
    * sudo systemctl start docker  (will start the docker service).
    * sudo systemctl enable docker (if we stop the VM docker service also will stop and once VM is start automatically it will start the docker service as well).
    * sudo systemctl restart docker (to restart the docker service).

-> Docker engine ---> which containes docker config and which heps to run the docker service
-> Docker Repository --> were you can store the docker images (here we can do pull/push mechanism)
-> Docker images -> we can build docker image using docker file 
-> Dockerfile ---> Group of instructions

Docker Commands:
-> **Docker info** ---- we can see the config/details about docker
-> **Docker images** ---- to see list of docker images
-> **Docker rmi <imagename>** --- to delete specific docker image
-> **Docker build -it <imagename> .** ----to build docker image from dockerfile
-> docker ps --- it will show the running containers
-> docker ps -a -- it will show both stop and running containers.
-> docker rm <containername> --- delete docker container (make sure container should be in stop state)
-> docker run -it --name <containername> <imagename> /bin/bash
-> docker commit <containerid> ---- from this we can build docker image
-> docker logs -f <containername> ----- to see container logs
-> docker exec -it <containername> /bin/bash  ------ to login into container
-> docker stats <containername> ---- you can see the resource utilization cpu/ram/memory
-> docker system prune ---- unused images/containers will be deleted
-> docker run -it --name <containername> --privileged=true --volumes-from <oldcontainer> <images> /bin/bash

what is kubernetes?
-> which helps you to deploy multiple applications as a containers, auto scaling and manage our applications.

**What is kubernetes components?**
-> control plane (master node) ----kube API Server, kube Controll manager, kube-scheduler, etcd
-> worker node --- kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime.

What is kubernetes pod?
-> Running as a container on kubernete

**What is deployment in kubernetes?**
-> Deployment is nothing but converts application as a running container and it should manage the roll back machanism.

**what is kubernetes namespace?**
-> kubernetes namespace which helps you to seperate the multiple application deployments configurations.

**what is kubernetes services?**
-> Service load balancer ----- which manages the external acces to kubernetes service
                               feature of load balancer -> SSL, Virtual Hosting, Ingress Routing -> which helps to route the traffic to kubernetes services.
-> NodePort ---- which helps to access the application from external world and it expose the Node IP address
                <NodeIP>:<NodePort>
-> Cluster IP ---- exposes the service on each node based on internal IP address with in the cluster. 

What is PV and PVC?
-> PV is persistent volumes stoages available for the cluster.
->PVC is persistent volume claim storages requested by user for storage which is bound to PV's.
